# Chess-
Designed a Chess game using python, data structures &amp; algorithms.
•Technique:
Created functions for King, queen, Bishop and Pawn to predict moves based on delta values of position of each piece.  For each selection position, flag is set. For each selection in the menu, the possible moves derived from these functions  get displayed and updated.


•Data Structures Used:
ArrayList, Array, Hash Map , 2 -Dimensional Array, Switch Case, For, While, if-else loops


• How to execute/run the program? : 
Execute .py or .ipynb file in Python IDE. Works best on Jupyter notebook!
1)Type the piece name (Rook, Knight, Bishop,Queen, King)
2)Type the position position you want to move to (0,1,2,3...7)
3)Type yes/no to continue or to exit the game.

Note: None of the input should be empty. 
      Pawn is not assumed to jump by 2 rows.
      Execution initially takes around 5 seconds.
